      <h2>Hello, I'm Viraj Jadhav 👋</h2>
      <p>Hey! I’m Viraj Jadhav a curious mind, tech enthusiast, and BCA student at JSPM University, Pune.<br>
         I’ve always been fascinated by how technology works behind the scenes, which led me to dive into programming languages like Java, C++, Python, and web development tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
         Lately, I’ve been exploring the world of cybersecurity understanding how to protect systems, detect threats, and build safer digital spaces. <br>
         I love working on hands-on projects, whether it’s building a smart IoT system, designing a user-friendly website, or experimenting with cybersecurity tools. <br>
         Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new skills, sharing knowledge, and connecting with like minded people.<br>
         I'm all about growing, building, and hopefully making the internet a little smarter and safer, one project at a time.</p>
